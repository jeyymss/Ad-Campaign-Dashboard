This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Technical Test â€” Ad Campaign Dashboard

A simple, responsive dashboard built as part of a technical hiring test, designed to fetch and display campaign data from a public API using modern frontend technologies.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Objective

The goal of this task is to demonstrate the ability to:

1. Build a clean, responsive UI

2. Fetch and display API data efficiently

3. Implement searching, filtering, and loading states

4. Follow best practices in React/Next.js development
